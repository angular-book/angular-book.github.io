# Chapter 2 - Quick Tour of Angular

In this section we will build a quick and dirty Angular application. The intention here is to give you a bit of experience with the tools, languages, and the basics of Angular's architecture and approach to building applications.

In this section we will install and use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) to create a basic Angular application. We will delete the majority of the generated code and build a simple application from "first principals" to help you understand the various _thingies_ that make up an Angular application, and their relationship to one another.
